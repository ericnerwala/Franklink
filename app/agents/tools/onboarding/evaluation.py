THEIR LATEST RESPONSE:

Score their response on these criteria (1-10 scale):

1. CLARITY (1-10): Can you understand what they're claiming?
   - 1-4: Confusing or nonsensical
   - 5-6: Understandable but vague
   - 7-10: Clear (MOST responses should be 7+)

2. CREDIBILITY (1-10): Does this sound real?
   - 1-4: Obviously fake or impossible
   - 5-6: Generic but plausible
   - 7-10: Sounds real (default to believing them)

3. SPECIFICITY (1-10): Are there concrete details?
   - 1-4: No specifics at all
   - 5-6: Some details (mentions a project, role, or context)
   - 7-10: Has numbers, names, or measurable outcomes

SCORING GUIDANCE - BE LENIENT:
- If they mention ANY numbers (users, revenue, team size, etc.) → minimum 6-7 overall
- If they describe a specific project or role → minimum 5-6 overall
- If they provide outcomes or impact → 7+ overall
- Only score below 5 for truly empty responses ("I work hard", "I'm good", etc.)

EXAMPLES:
- "I work at a startup" → overall: 4 (no details)
- "I built an AI agent" → overall: 5 (mentions project)
- "My app has 1000 users" → overall: 7 (has numbers!)
- "1000 users and helps find co-founders" → overall: 7-8 (numbers + use case)
